## Reflection

The project was a passion project created in the summer of 2023. The project's goals included: Learning SwiftUI, mobile development practices, and breaking the barrier for Asian Americans and their immigrant grandparents by creating a birthday reminder app with a Chinese calendar converter.

I was interested in learning Swift to solve this problem, and I was faced with the decision to learn either Storyboard or SwiftUI. I went with the latter because I read that Apple is focused on SwiftUI for the future, and that was more appealing to me. I watched various Youtubers of creating simple apps. Most of the time it was smooth sailing, a lot of the features are developed already and it's a matter of finding the right puzzle piece that fits. 

Other times, I would get stuck for days. My main struggles were as follows: Core data, notifications, photo picker and crop, image loading, navigation stack, and Chinese calendar converter. The problem was that SwiftUI was so new that sometimes finding the right answer to my bugs was difficult because there wasn't much information online. For example, there isn't a built-in crop feature with the photo picker or collapsible wheel date picker. Through perseverance, asking the community for help on Discord, and breaks with frustrating bugs, I managed to overcome all obstacles without ever being involved in mobile development before this project.

This is an ongoing project. In my work-in-progress section, I listed all of the features I still intend on implementing. While I do believe my project is far along enough to be considered a minimal viable product, I still am going through rigorous testing before I attempt to launch it in the app store. With real users using my app and giving feedback, I can improve it further.
